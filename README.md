Author: Elizabeth Yates

In this repository, I complete the following assignment. 

1. The Calculator App (the_calculator_app.py)
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Task 1: Create functions for each arithmetic operation.

Task 2: Use inputs to ask the user what operation they want to perform, and what numbers they want to use.

Task 3: Ensure your code can handle division by zero and other potential errors. So if you divide by 0, there is error handling set up to prevent an error from showing in the console.

2. The Shopping List Maker (the_shopping_list_maker.py)
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to create a program that helps users make a shopping list.

Task 1: Write a function that lets the user add items to a list.

Task 2: Include a function to remove items from the list.

Task 3: Add a function that prints out the entire list in a formatted way.
